[AI in Software Development – IBM Think](https://www.ibm.com/blog/ai-in-software-development)

## Why I Found This Article Interesting
I found this article fascinating because it explains how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the entire software development lifecycle.  
From automating code generation and testing to improving project management and documentation, AI is helping developers work faster, reduce errors, and focus on more complex and creative tasks.

I liked how the article breaks down AI’s impact across multiple areas: code generation, bug detection, testing, DevOps, UX design, and architecture planning.  
It also explains how AI is becoming accessible not just to developers but also to non-technical users through no-code and low-code platforms.  
The article gave me a clear picture of how AI is not replacing developers, but augmenting their work, allowing for more innovation and higher quality software.
